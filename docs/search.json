    "text": "5.2 Population trends\nFrom 2010 to 2020, the Lynchburg region only grew by six percent, an increase of just over 15,000 people. This slow but steady growth across the last decade was punctuated by a slight decrease in population between 2019 and 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Total regional population\n\n\n\nFor much of the last decade, growth in the region has been a result of both domestic migration and international migration. But from 2020 to 2021, there were significant shifts in the causes of population change in the region. Deaths outpaced births during this time, leading to a loss of over 600 individuals. International migration decreased, while domestic migration overwhelmingly became the reason for growth in the region.\nThese changes within the region were no doubt a result of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact. With the increase in work-from-home (WFH), households from outside the region saw an opportunity to benefit from the relative affordability of the region, while still earning high wages from elsewhere. And sadly, the pandemic’s impact also contributed to losses among the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Regional components of population change\n\n\n\nDespite the slight population decline from from 2019 to 2020, the region is projected to near 300,000 people by 2050 — a 13 percent increase from the 2020 Census.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Regional population projections"

    "text": "5.3 Household trends\nFrom 2010 to 2021, there has been a continuous increase in the number of renter households in the region. Cumulatively, there has been an increase of 3,226 renters since 2010. Although, there has been a cumulative increase in the number of homeowner households since 2010 — that increase is only recent as of 2020 and 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Regional change in household tenure\n\n\n\nThe growing number of homeowners in the region are overwhelmingly the result of seniors (65 years and over). Between 2010 and 2021, there was an increase of 5,796 senior homeowners. The growth in homeowners was offset by major decreases in homeowners aged between 25 and 64 years old — an overall decrease of 5,180. Renter households saw increases across all age groups, but the greatest increase was among 45 to 64 year olds (+1,323).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Regional change in households by age and tenure\n\n\n\nAmong household types, householders not living alone grew by 1,430 from 2010 to 2021 — more than any other household type. This household type mostly represents households with unrelated household members (i.e. living with roommates). Household types like this are expected in regions with major universities, but they can also be an indicator of affordability challenges as individuals increasingly need additional household members to contribute to rent or mortgages.\nHouseholders living alone follow at an increase of 1,133. Household formation continues to be delayed among many individuals — contributing to the growing number of one-person households. But in the Lynchburg region, married couple households follow closely behind with an increase of 1,059 since 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6: Regional change in households by type\n\n\n\nThe region saw its greatest gains among households — both homeowners and renters — with two people or less. Two-person renter households saw the most growth between 2010 and 2021, increasing by 2,409. Household with three or more people only grew slightly, but three-person homeowner households actually saw a decline (-1,642).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.7: Regional change in households by size and tenure\n\n\n\nThe senior population grew by 9,021 individuals from 2010 to 2021. Much of that growth occurred among seniors living with family — mainly as a householder (+3,233) or as the spouse in a family (+3,091). The third largest change in the senior population was among seniors living alone (+2,291). This senior living arrangement can be a concern for communities. With more and more seniors living alone, aging-in-place is made more difficult without support from others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.8: Regional change in senior population\n\n\n\nWith housing affordability becoming more and more of a challenge for families, some families are forced to live with others. These families are called subfamilies, and within the Lynchburg region subfamilies are more than likely to be single mothers. But in recent years, the number of single fathers and married couples (both with and without children) living with another family has been on the rise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.9: Regional change in families living with others\n\n\n\nWhile more and more families are living with other families, the number of multigenerational households has also increased in recent years — especially within Lynchburg and Campbell County, where the percentage of the population living in multigenerational households increased 2.4 percentage points from 2016 (5.5 percent) to 2020 (7.9 percent).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.10: Regional percentage of multigenerational households\n\n\n\nWhile other parts of Virginia are seeing an increasing number of adult children returning home to live with parents, this is not so much the case in the Lynchburg region. Young adults (18 to 34 years old) are increasingly living with a partner in the region, a 38 percent increase between 2015 and 2021. Adults living with their parents only increased by 1.5 percent during this same timeframe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.11: Regional change in young adult population by living arrangement"

A greater share of homeowners are now in the $100,000 and more income range than back in 2010. Renter incomes have also shifted upwards but not as dramatically towards the upper income bands. In 2021, there 5,060 more renter households making between $50,000 and $149,999, a 92 percent increase.\nRegardless of these shifts, income distributions for renter households continue to skew towards the low end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.12: Regional income distribution by tenure\n\n\n\nBetween homeowner and renter households there is a $35,236 gap in median household income.

Much of the single-family housing stock resides in homeownership, but in 2015 single-family housing decreased roughly two percentage points from homeownership towards rental. Manufactured homes, which is included in the Other category, has continued to make up the second largest portion of the region’s housing stock (10 percent overall).\nRental housing stock is diverse and has grown to include duplexes, tri-plexes, and quads, as well as larger multifamily properties. While these smaller multifamily properties like duplexes once made up nearly two percent of the homeownership market, they have reduced to a half of a percent of the region’s entire housing stock.\nOptions like these have been touted as Missing Middle Housing, which are able to offer affordable homeownership options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.15: Regional housing stock by structure type\n\n\n\nMost of the region’s housing is surpassing 20 years in age. A construction boom in the late 20th century (from 1960 to 1999) contributed to much of the region’s homeownership and rental housing stock. With aging housing stock, housing quality becomes an ever-present issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.16: Regional housing stock by year built\n\n\n\nThe number of smaller bedroom homes has been declining since 2010, particularly within the existing homeowner housing stock. From 2010 to 2021, there was a loss of 2,435 two-bedroom homes in homeownership. Some of that loss could be accounted for in a transition to rental, but two-bedroom rentals only increased by 1,487. One-bedroom rentals, often in-demand by young professionals, as well as those most in need, also so a decline (-191), but two-bedroom rentals accounted for much of the growth in the rental market.\nLarger homes with three or more bedrooms saw the greatest increase in the region. Although larger homes are meeting a demand, they often come at the expense of affordability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.17: Change in regional housing stock by bedroom count\n\n\n\nManufactured housing communities are spread out across the region. These homes often serve as market-rate affordable housing, but they are face several challenges, including risk of redevelopment, poor housing quality, and aging infrastructure.\nThere are 99 manufactured home communities in the region. Three quarters of the communities in the region are small, consisting of less than 50 homes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nInsert information about MHC tenure and issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.18: Map of manufactured home communities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.19: Manufactured home communities by size\n\n\n\nThe region has still not recovered to its Great Recession building-levels, when residential building permits peaked at 1,840 in 2005. Since 2012, permits have only averaged at 768 per year, less than half of what it was in 2005.\nIn addition, the early 2000s saw a greater number of two to four bedroom homes. But by 2005, these diverse types of housing were nearly non-existent from the building pipeline in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.20: Regional residential building permits"

Although fluctuating between $180,000 and $225,000 between 2016 and 2019, the region saw a major bump in early 2020 as the pandemic impacts hit the region’s housing market that have kept home prices well-above $225,000 ever since.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.22: Regional median residential sales price\n\n\n\nThe impact of the pandemic is most noticeable when looking at the number of closed home sales and average days on market.

    "section": "5.8 Affordability",
    "text": "5.8 Affordability\nHousing affordability is most often defined by housing where a homeowner or tenant is spending no more than 30 percent of their income on their housing costs. Those households that spend more than 30 percent are considered housing cost-burdened. This metric is a standard measurement for housing affordability, especially in terms of state and federal programs.\nIn the region, there was a total of 23,419 cost-burdened households in 2021, fifty-three percent of which were renters. This 2021 estimates is a 12 percent decrease from 2010 (-3,123), when the total cost-burdened households was 26,542. At that time, 59 percent of those cost-burdened households were homeowners, indicating a major shift in who is cost-burdened in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development receives custom tabulations of American Community Survey data from the U.S. Census Bureau. This data is used to demonstrate the breadth of housing needs across the country. This data lags behind ACS data by about two years, but it provides a snapshot of the different impacts of cost burden by area median income, household type, and race and ethnicity.\nFrom 2012 to 2019, Cost burden in the region has generally been declining for higher income households, particularly those making above 50 percent AMI. But for households making 30 percent AMI or less, cost burden has increased rapidly between 2017 and 2018, going from 67 percent to 79 percent. Although there was an overall decline in cost-burdened households making 30 percent AMI or less between these years, the share grew significantly.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.27: Total regional housing cost burden by household area median income\n\n\n\nAcross all household types, cost burden has been declining from 2012 to 2019. However, nearly a third of elderly, non-family (31 percent) and non-elderly, non-family (37 percent) household types are cost-burdened. These households are typically individuals living alone or with other unrelated adults. Family households are less likely to be cost-burdened, but nearly one in five large and small family households were still cost-burdened in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.28: Regional cost-burden by household type\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere has been a decline in the share of cost-burdened white and Asian households in the region between 2012 and 2019, while there has been little to no change in cost burden for other racial and ethnic groups. Although Hispanics in the region saw an initial decline in cost burden from 2012 to 2013, that decline was negated by 2019, when the percent of cost-burdened Hispanic households reached 37 percent, a two percentage point increase from 2012.\nDisparities exist and have persisted in regards to race and ethnicity and cost burden. White households are less likely to be cost-burdened than any other racial or ethnic group in the region. As of 2019, 20 percent of white households were cost-burdened. The closest group were Asian households and yet they were still eight percentage points above their white counterparts. Black, Hispanic, and other racial groups (including multiracial households) experienced cost burden at least 15 percentage points above white households.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.29: Regional percent of cost-burdened households by race and ethnicity"

As of 2021, there were 2,264 more homeowners in Bedford than in 2010.\nAppomattox’s growth has been mainly among homeowner households, while renters have declined overall. For Amherst, there has been similar declines in both renters and homeowners.\nMeanwhile, Campbell County has seen the greatest increases in renters among the counties. From 2010 to 2021, there was an increase of 650 renter households and a decrease of 412 homeowners in Campbell.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Local cumulative change in households by tenure\n\n\n\nThe loss of younger households is common among the counties. The percentage of both renter and homeowner householders 45 years old or less have been declining since 2010. But older renters (45 years old and older) have been coming into the counties. Appomattox, in particular, saw an 81 percent increase in renters aged 45 to 64 years old between 2010 and 2021, while Bedford experienced a 56 percent increase in renters 65 years old and over. The growth in homeowners was predominantly among householders aged 65 years and over, where all countied experienced an over 25 percent increase since 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: Local percent change in households by age and tenure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough younger householders are declining in the counties, smaller households are increasing. One-person homeowners households are increasing in Amherst, Appomattox, and Bedford. Unlike its neighbors, Campbell is seeing an increase in both one-person renter and homeowner households. Two-person households are overwhelmingly increasing in Bedford.\nThe counties that did see an increase in larger households were Amherst, Bedford, and Campbell. These increases were mainly among renter households, but Bedford saw an increase of four-person households for both homeowners and renters.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: Local cumulative change in households by size and tenure\n\n\n\nThe increases in smaller households may be accounted for by increases in the senior (65 years and over) population. But increasing number of seniors living alone can be of great concern for localities. Although many seniors desire to maintain their independence, professionals note that older adults who live alone are more likely to be poor. Campbell had the largest increase in seniors living alone from 2012 to 2021 (+1,241), followed by Bedford at an addition of 919 seniors living alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: Local change in senior population living alone\n\n\n\nRising costs in the region can force families to double up with others. Single parents with children are the most common family type that is experiencing this living situation. But over the last decade, there has been an increasing number of single parents with children living with others in Amherst County. Married couples with and without children are more likely to be in Amherst or Campbell, and their numbers have also been increasing in the last decade.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.9: Local change in families living with others\n\n\n\nAdult children living parents can also be an indicator of affordability challenges. Campbell has consistently seen a decrease in the number of adult children living with parents since 2015, an overall decrease of 511 adults between the age of 18 and 34. Although Amherst and Bedford experienced relatively major increases by 2020, changes in the population led to an overall minimal increase (+75) for Amherst and a decrease for Bedford (-37). Appomattox saw the largest increase in adult children living with parents compared to 2015 estimates (+151).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.10: Local cumulative change in adult children living with parents"

    "text": "6.5 Housing stock\nThe counties contribute to 36 percent of the region’s total housing stock. The majority of that share consists of single-family housing that is utilized for homeownership. Among the homeownership housing stock in the counties, there is little diversity as the only other type of housing is in the “Other” category, which includes manufactured homes. Two to four unit homes, like duplexes and quads, can look like single-family housing and can often be more affordable, but the counties only contribute one percent of this type of housing to the region’s total stock.\nRenter housing stock in the counties is diverse, but still largely made up of single-family housing.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.14: Distribution of house stock in the region\n\n\n\n[1] 0.01286465\n\n\nManufactured home communities are prevalent among the four counties. Campbell alone has 41 manufactured home communities, most of which are communities of less than 50 homes. Bedford follows at 30 communities, 22 of which are small communities.\nAlthough many of these communities make up a bulk of rural communities’ affordable housing stock, they are often plagued with housing quality issues. This is due to the prevalence of pre-HUD Code mobile homes located in parks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.15: Local manufactured home communities by size\n\n\n\nLocal residential building permits show that the four counties have experienced the Great Recession and subsequent recovery differently. Bedford was on the rise pre-Recession but has struggled to recover to those previous levels, especially throughout the pandemic. But development in Bedford in recent years has focused on multifamily development (5 or more units), where it is undoubtedly centralized in the Town of Bedford.\nCampbell was also seeing major growth ahead of the Great Recession but has seen starts and stops throughout the last decade. On the other hand, Amherst and Appomattox have seen little change in their building permit trends over the last two decades.\nRegardless of these changes, there is a severe lack of diverse housing being built in the counties. Homes like duplexes are virtually non-existent in the development pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.16: Local esidential building permits by type"

Appomattox and Campbell were initially seeing rising homeownership rates throughout the first half of the decade, but those gains began to turn to losses in the second half. For Amherst, decreasing homeownership is a recent trend from 2020 to 2021 and it is uncertain whether this will continue.\nBedford’s homeownership rate was affected by the reversion of the city to town status, but in recent years, homeownership has been rising dramatically.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.17: Local homeownership rates"

But as rental prices in Bedford began to rise gradually, prices in Amherst, Appomattox, and Campbell saw declines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAdd blurb about small sample sizes for Amherst and Appomattox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.18: Local quarterly average market asking rents\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRental housing supported by federal subsidy in the counties is most likely to be found in Bedford, no doubt a result of the former City of Bedford’s inclusion in the data. Most of the subsidized housing in the counties is made up of project-based Section 8 rental housing (306 units, most of which resides in Bedford). The second most common subsidized housing is the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) (282 units), then followed by the Rental Housing Section 515 Program administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) (266 units).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor more information about these federal housing programs, please visit the National Housing Preservation Database’s Program Descriptions page.\n\n\nCampbell is not represented among federal housing programs, but it is important to note that these estimates on affordable housing do not include tenant-based assistance like Housing Choice Vouchers (HCVs) or state-funded programs.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.19: Federally assisted rental homes by county\n\n\n\nHousing Choice Vouchers allow low-income individuals and families to find housing in the private market. HCVs serve as rental assistance to help households pay for housing that may exceed the value of the voucher. HCVs can also be project-based vouchers, meaning that a housing authority can re-allocate funding to tie a tenant-based voucher to a specific housing development.\nIn the counties, there are 248 HCVs being used by low-income households. Forty-two percent of those vouchers are being utilized in Campbell County.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.20: Housing Choice Voucher utilization in the counties"

Meanwhile, in Appomattox and Campbell, 29 percent of elderly, non-family households (i.e. seniors living alone or with unrelated persons) were cost-burdened in 2019. These two household types face the most difficult challenges in affordability, most likely due to the challenges of affording housing alone. But interestingly, just over one in four (26 percent) large families in Appomattox are cost-burdened, a divergence from trends in the other three counties.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.23: Local cost-burden by household type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.24: Local rental housing gap by AMI"

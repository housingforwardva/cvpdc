    "text": "1.4 The importance of a regional housing study\nHousing challenges span local boundaries\nCommunities throughout the Central Virginia region face different housing challenges, but the need for more affordable housing is a common thread in rural, suburban, and urban areas. A diverse and accessible housing supply is critical for promoting equitable and sustainable communities, and housing affordability is a basic need for individuals and families at all income levels. A regional housing study acknowledges that housing markets extend beyond individual communities and that decisions made in one area can have far-reaching consequences in neighboring communities.\nThe Central Virginia Planning District is composed of four primarily rural counties and the city of Lynchburg and its growing suburbs as the central urban core. The region has seen moderate population growth in recent years primarily as a result of domestic migration due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of remote work options. This has led to increases in home prices and rental vacancy declines as higher income workers relocated out of D.C. and larger east coast metros to benefit from the relative affordability of the region. More and more, smaller and older households are being seen in the region, and affordability challenges are continuing to hit people of color, renters, and those living alone the most.\nWith a wide range of housing for people of all incomes, the region can continue to be a place to call home for both new and existing residents. By adopting a regional perspective, local policymakers can develop more holistic and effective strategies to address housing affordability, equity, transportation, and sustainability, resulting in a more resilient and inclusive regional housing market that aligns with the vision of a thriving region."

    "text": "3.1 Key highlights\n\nHousing market dynamics\n\nHousing demand outstrips supply in the Central Virginia region in nearly all sectors of the market. This dynamic has led rents and home prices to surge. Local residents are increasingly outbid by newcomers from larger metro areas who are relocating and have higher purchasing power. Affordable options for low-income renters are now disappearing, leading to increased housing insecurity.\n\nChallenges and needs\n\nA wide range of regulatory, economic, and political barriers prevent new housing from being easily produced today. Local governments only have control over some of these areas—notably land use—but have room to make improvements. Some challenges, such as limited senior housing options and an accelerating short-term rental market, will require unique solutions.\n\nService provision\n\nHousing agencies and nonprofit providers are doing good work, but their current capacity is far below the current (and growing) needs of low-income renters, homeowners, and persons experiencing homelessness.\n\nProposed solutions\n\nParticipants’ ideas for improving housing opportunities included (but were not limited to) new messaging strategies, expanding cross-sector collaborations, reducing zoning barriers, and generating new locally-funded housing assistance programs."

This slow but steady growth across the last decade was punctuated by a slight decrease in population between 2019 and 2020. In more recent years, the population has recovered to its 2019 estimate, now having an estimated population of 263,613 as of 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Total population of CVPDC region\n\n\n\nFor much of the last decade, growth in the region has been a result of both domestic migration and international migration. But from 2020 to 2021, there were significant shifts in the causes of population change. Deaths outpaced births during this time, leading to a loss of over 600 individuals. International migration decreased, while domestic migration overwhelmingly became the reason for growth in the region.\nThese changes within the region were no doubt a result of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact. With the increase in work-from-home (WFH), households from outside the region saw an opportunity to benefit from the relative affordability of the region, while still earning high wages from elsewhere. And sadly, the pandemic’s impact also contributed to losses among the community.\nRecent changes in the population from 2020 to 2022 have shown the overwhelming impact of domestic migration to the region. The natural decreases post-2020 have been substantial for the region, resulting in a loss of 1,100 residents from 2020 to 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Components of population change\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Population projections\nDespite the slight population decline from from 2019 to 2020 and the slow growth in recent years, the region is projected to near 300,000 people by 2050 — a 13 percent increase from the 2020 Census.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Projected total population"

    "text": "4.3 Household trends\n\n4.3.1 Household tenure\nFrom 2010 to 2021, there has been a continuous increase in the number of renter households in the region. Cumulatively, there has been an increase of 3,226 renters since 2010. Although, there has been a cumulative increase in the number of homeowner households since 2010 — that increase is only recent as of 2020 and 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Cumulative change in households by tenure\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Householder age\nThe growing number of homeowners in the region are overwhelmingly the result of seniors (65 years and over). Between 2010 and 2021, there was an increase of 5,796 senior homeowners. The growth in homeowners was offset by major decreases in homeowners aged between 25 and 64 years old — an overall decrease of 5,180. Renter households saw increases across all age groups, but the greatest increase was among 45 to 64 year olds (+1,323).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Change in households by age and tenure\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Household types\nAmong household types, householders not living alone grew by 1,430 from 2010 to 2021 — more than any other household type. This household type mostly represents households with unrelated household members (i.e. living with roommates). Household types like this are expected in regions with major universities, but they can also be an indicator of affordability challenges as individuals increasingly need additional household members to contribute to rent or mortgages.\nHouseholders living alone follow at an increase of 1,133. Household formation continues to be delayed among many individuals — contributing to the growing number of one-person households. But in the Lynchburg region, married couple households follow closely behind with an increase of 1,059 since 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Change in households by type\n\n\n\nThe region saw its greatest gains among households — both homeowners and renters — with two people or less. Two-person renter households saw the most growth between 2010 and 2021, increasing by 2,409. Household with three or more people only grew slightly, but three-person homeowner households actually saw a decline (-1,642).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: Change in households by size and tenure\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.4 Seniors and individuals with disabilities\nThe senior population grew by 9,021 individuals from 2012 to 2021. Much of that growth occurred among seniors living with family — mainly as a householder (+3,233) or as the spouse in a family (+3,091). The third largest change in the senior population was among seniors living alone (+2,291). This senior living arrangement can be a concern for communities. With more and more seniors living alone, aging-in-place is made more difficult without support from others.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8: Change in senior population by living arrangement\n\n\n\nAmbulatory difficulties (serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs) among adults presents challenges when it comes to accessible and affordable housing. These individuals often need single-story homes that have been retrofitted to make getting around easier. The number of adults with an ambulatory difficulty in the region has declined only slightly over the last decade from 18,264 in 2010 to 17,753 by 2021, a 511 person decrease.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.9: Adults with ambulatory difficulty\n\n\n\nThe number of adults with an independent living difficulty has also seen little change over the past 10 years. Although there was a decline from 2020 to 2021, there are still over 13,000 adults in the region who have difficulty living by themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.10: Adults with independent difficulty\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.11: Adults with independent difficulty\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.5 Subfamilies and multigenerational households\nWith housing affordability becoming more and more of a challenge for families, some families are forced to live with others. This creates subfamilies, which the Census Bureau defines as:\n\nA married couple (with or without children) or an unmarried parent with one or more never-married children under the age of 18, residing with the householder, but not including the householder’s spouse.\nWhen grown children move back to the parental home with their own children under 18 or a spouse, they are considered a subfamily.\n\nWithin the Lynchburg region subfamilies are more than likely to be single mothers. But in recent years, the number of single fathers and married couples (both with and without children) living with another family has been on the rise.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.12: Subfamilies by type and presence of own children\n\n\n\nWhile more and more families are living with other families, the number of multigenerational households has also increased in recent years — especially within Lynchburg and Campbell County, where the percentage of the population living in multigenerational households increased 2.4 percentage points from 2016 (5.5 percent) to 2020 (7.9 percent).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.13: Percent of population living in multiple generation households\n\n\n\nWhile other parts of Virginia are seeing an increasing number of adult children returning home to live with parents, this is not so much the case in the Lynchburg region. Young adults (18 to 34 years old) are increasingly living with a partner in the region, a 38 percent increase between 2015 and 2021. Adults living with their parents only increased by 1.5 percent during this same timeframe.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.14: Percent change in young adult population by living arrangement"

    "text": "4.4 Economic trends\n\n4.4.1 Household incomes\nIn the region, the distribution of homeowner incomes have shifted upwards. A greater share of homeowners are now in the $100,000 and more income range than back in 2010. Renter incomes have also shifted upwards but not as dramatically towards the upper income bands. In 2021, there 5,060 more renter households making between $50,000 and $149,999, a 92 percent increase.\nRegardless of these shifts, income distributions for renter households continue to skew towards the low end.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.15: Households by income and tenure\n\n\n\nBetween homeowner and renter households there is a $35,236 gap in median household income. Adjusting for inflation shows that median household income has been relatively flat for homeowners in the last decade (7 percent increase), while the typical income for renters saw modest gains (18 percent increase).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.16: Median household income by tenure\n\n\n\nGaps in income between different races and ethnicities in the region continue to further racial inequities — especially in the housing market. Black households in the region make a fraction of what their white counterparts make. For every dollar a typical white household makes, a Black household only makes 62 percent of that dollar.\nHispanic households in the region have made major gains in income. When comparing inflation-adjusted income, Hispanic households in the region saw a 17 percent increase in median household income, the largest gain among any other group.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.17: Median household income by race and ethnicity\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Wages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWage data in this section is sourced from the Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) program of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. OEWS is updated annually, most recently for 2022 data. This dataset provides a rich look into wage distribution by industry and occupation.\nHowever, OEWS is only available at the national, state, and metro levels. Therefore, the data below covers the full Lynchburg, Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA).\n\n\nLike other regions in the state, regional wages increased across the board from May 2019 to May 2022. The largest percent increases in average wages were among jobs that paid at and below the median wage. In fact, the largest growth occurred in the lowest 10th percentile of wages, due in large part to state lawmakers adopting incremental increases to Virginia’s minimum wage in 2020. The first increase from $7.25 to $9.50 per hour took effect in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nToday, state minimum wage is $11.00 per hour. Under current law, it will increase again to $12.00 in 2023. Lawmakers must reenact the measure by July 2024 to initiative further increases to $15.00 per hour by 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.18: Percent change in annual wage in Lynchburg, VA MSA\n\n\n\nOver this same period, wages in the region grew for all five of the most common occupation categories by total employment numbers. Workers in the Food Preparation and Serving Related sector saw the largest increases—from an average annual salary of $19,950 to $25,680 (nearly 30 percent).\nJobs in Production, Transportation and Material Moving, Office and Administrative Support, and Sales and Related sectors—totaling 46,610 in the region as of May 2022—also saw wage growth more than the 13 percent average increase.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.19: Percent change in annual wage for top 5 most common occupation categories\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Unemployment\nThrough much of the early parts of the pandemic, the Lynchburg region saw record high unemployment rates, topping out at 10.5 percent in April 2020. This rate surpassed the post-Recession fall out when the unemployment rate was 8.7 percent in February 2010.\nMore recently, employment recovery post COVID-19 brought about a record low unemployment rate in November 2021. But recent trends are showing growing unemployment on par with pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.20: Unemployment rate in the Lynchburg region"

    "text": "4.5 Housing stock\n\n4.5.1 Housing type\nThe bulk of the region’s housing stock is composed of single-family housing (74 percent). Much of the single-family housing stock resides in homeownership, but in 2015 single-family housing decreased roughly two percentage points from homeownership towards rental. Manufactured homes, which is included in the Other category, has continued to make up the second largest portion of the region’s housing stock (10 percent overall).\nRental housing stock is diverse and has grown to include duplexes, tri-plexes, and quads, as well as larger multifamily properties. While these smaller multifamily properties like duplexes once made up nearly two percent of the homeownership market, they have reduced to a half of a percent of the region’s entire housing stock.\nOptions like these have been touted as Missing Middle Housing, which are able to offer affordable homeownership options.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.21: Housing stock by structure type and tenure\n\n\n\nMost of the region’s housing is surpassing 20 years in age. A construction boom in the late 20th century (from 1960 to 1999) contributed to much of the region’s homeownership and rental housing stock. With aging housing stock, housing quality becomes an ever-present issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.22: Housing stock by year built and tenure\n\n\n\nThe number of smaller bedroom homes has been declining since 2010, particularly within the existing homeowner housing stock. From 2010 to 2021, there was a loss of 2,435 two-bedroom homes in homeownership. Some of that loss could be accounted for in a transition to rental, but two-bedroom rentals only increased by 1,487. One-bedroom rentals, often in-demand by young professionals, as well as those most in need, also a decline (-191), but two-bedroom rentals accounted for much of the rental market growth.\nLarger homes with three or more bedrooms saw the greatest increase in the region. Although larger homes are meeting a demand, they often come at the expense of affordability.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.23: Change in housing stock by number of bedrooms and tenure\n\n\n\nManufactured home communities are spread out across the region. These homes often serve as market-rate affordable housing, but they face several challenges, including risk of redevelopment, poor housing quality, and aging infrastructure.\nThere are 99 manufactured home communities in the region. Three quarters of the communities in the region are small, consisting of less than 50 homes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManufactured homes: a valuable resource\n\n\n\nManufactured homes have faced significant stigma due to their association with mobile homes or trailer homes built before 1976. In 1976, the manufactured home industry and the federal government created stricter standards for the construction of these homes. The HUD Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards (the “HUD code”) has helped ensure that manufactured homes are safe and high quality.\nDespite the HUD code, many pre-1976 mobile homes persist across the nation — especially in mobile home parks. In many instances, residents of these homes face significant challenges in energy efficiency, weatherization, and housing stability.

    "text": "4.8 Affordability\nHousing affordability is most often defined by housing where a homeowner or tenant is spending no more than 30 percent of their income on their housing costs. Those households that spend more than 30 percent are considered housing cost-burdened. This metric is a standard measurement for housing affordability, especially in terms of state and federal programs.\nIn the region, there was a total of 23,419 cost-burdened households in 2021, fifty-three percent of which were renters. This 2021 estimates is a 12 percent decrease from 2010 (-3,123), when the total cost-burdened households was 26,542. At that time, 59 percent of those cost-burdened households were homeowners, indicating a major shift in who is cost-burdened in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.37: Cost-burdened households by tenure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development receives custom tabulations of American Community Survey data from the U.S. Census Bureau. This data is used to demonstrate the breadth of housing needs across the country. This data lags behind ACS data by about two years, but it provides a snapshot of the different impacts of cost burden by area median income, household type, and race and ethnicity.\nFrom 2012 to 2020, cost burden in the region has generally been declining for higher income households, particularly those making above 50 percent AMI. But for households making 30 percent AMI or less, cost burden has increased rapidly between 2017 and 2018, going from 67 percent to 79 percent. Although there was an overall decline in cost-burdened households making 30 percent AMI or less between these years, the share grew significantly.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.38: Cost burden by household income\n\n\n\nAcross all household types, cost burden has been declining from 2012 to 2020. However, nearly a third of elderly, non-family (30 percent) and non-elderly, non-family (33 percent) household types are cost-burdened. These households are typically individuals living alone or with other unrelated adults. Family households are less likely to be cost-burdened, but nearly one in five large and small family households were still cost-burdened in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.39: Cost burden by household type\n\n\n\nThere has been a decline in the share of cost-burdened white, multiracial, and Asian households in the region between 2012 and 2020, while cost burden among Black households has seen the least amount of change. Although Hispanics were seeing increasing cost burden early in the decade, there has seemingly been a shift towards decreasing cost burden more recently.\nDisparities exist and have persisted in regards to race and ethnicity and cost burden. White households are less likely to be cost-burdened than any other racial or ethnic group in the region. As of 2020, 18 percent of white households were cost-burdened. The closest group were Asian households and yet they were still eight percentage points above their white counterparts. Black and Hispanic experienced cost burden at least 15 percentage points above white households.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.40: Cost burden by race and ethnicity"

    "text": "5.3 Household trends\nThe counties are seeing varying changes among homeowner and renter households. Bedford has seen a major increase in homeowners throughout much of the last decade. As of 2021, there were 2,264 more homeowners in Bedford than in 2010.\nAppomattox’s growth has been mainly among homeowner households, while renters have declined overall. For Amherst, there has been similar declines in both renters and homeowners.\nMeanwhile, Campbell County has seen the greatest increases in renters among the counties. From 2010 to 2021, there was an increase of 650 renter households and a decrease of 412 homeowners in Campbell.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Cumulative change in households by tenure\n\n\n\nThe loss of younger households is common among the counties. The percentage of both renter and homeowner householders 45 years old or less have been declining since 2010. But older renters (45 years old and older) have been coming into the counties. Appomattox, in particular, saw an 81 percent increase in renters aged 45 to 64 years old between 2010 and 2021, while Bedford experienced a 56 percent increase in renters 65 years old and over. The growth in homeowners was predominantly among householders aged 65 years and over, where all countied experienced an over 25 percent increase since 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6: Percent change in households by age and tenure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough younger householders are declining in the counties, smaller households are increasing. One-person homeowners households are increasing in Amherst, Appomattox, and Bedford. Unlike its neighbors, Campbell is seeing an increase in both one-person renter and homeowner households. Two-person households are overwhelmingly increasing in Bedford.\nThe counties that did see an increase in larger households were Amherst, Bedford, and Campbell. These increases were mainly among renter households, but Bedford saw an increase of four-person households for both homeowners and renters.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.7: Change in households by size and tenure\n\n\n\nThe increases in smaller households may be accounted for by increases in the senior (65 years and over) population. But increasing number of seniors living alone can be of great concern for localities. Although many seniors desire to maintain their independence, professionals note that older adults who live alone are more likely to be poor. Campbell had the largest increase in seniors living alone from 2012 to 2021 (+1,241), followed by Bedford at an addition of 919 seniors living alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.8: Change in senior population living alone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.9: Adults with ambulatory difficulty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.10: Adults with independent difficulty\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.11: Adults with independent difficulty\n\n\n\nRising costs in the region can force families to double up with others. This creates subfamilies, which the Census Bureau defines as:\n\nA married couple (with or without children) or an unmarried parent with one or more never-married children under the age of 18, residing with the householder, but not including the householder’s spouse.\nWhen grown children move back to the parental home with their own children under 18 or a spouse, they are considered a subfamily.\n\nSingle parents with children are the most common subfamily type that is experiencing this living situation. But over the last decade, there has been an increasing number of single parents with children living with others in Amherst County. Married couples with and without children are more likely to be in Amherst or Campbell, and their numbers have also been increasing in the last decade.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.12: Change in sufamilies living with others\n\n\n\nAdult children living parents can also be an indicator of affordability challenges. Campbell has consistently seen a decrease in the number of adult children living with parents since 2015, an overall decrease of 511 adults between the age of 18 and 34. Although Amherst and Bedford experienced relatively major increases by 2020, changes in the population led to an overall minimal increase (+75) for Amherst and a decrease for Bedford (-37). Appomattox saw the largest increase in adult children living with parents compared to 2015 estimates (+151).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.13: Local cumulative change in adult children living with parents"

Among the owner-occupied housing stock in the counties, there is little diversity as the only other type of housing with noticeable amounts is the “Other” category, which includes manufactured homes.\nRenter housing stock in the counties is diverse, but still largely made up of single-family homes and manufactured homes. Two to four unit homes, like duplexes and quads, can look like single-family housing and can often be more affordable, but the counties only contribute one percent of this type of housing to the region’s total stock.\nBedford and Campbell counties are the two jurisdictions with the largest share of actual multifamily rental units, while Appomattox County has the lowest. Amherst County has the highest share of two to four unit apartment buildings, which make up just over 25 percent of the county’s total rental stock.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.17: Housing stock by structure type and tenure\n\n\n\nManufactured home communities are prevalent among the four counties. Campbell alone has 41 manufactured home communities, most of which are communities of less than 50 homes. Bedford follows at 30 communities, 22 of which are small communities.\nAlthough many of these communities make up a bulk of rural communities’ affordable housing stock, they are often plagued with housing quality issues. This is due to the prevalence of pre-HUD Code mobile homes located in parks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.18: Manufactured home communities by size\n\n\n\nLocal residential building permits show that the four counties have experienced the Great Recession and subsequent recovery differently. Bedford was on the rise pre-Recession but has struggled to recover to those previous levels, especially throughout the pandemic. But development in Bedford in recent years has focused on multifamily development (5 or more units), where it is undoubtedly centralized in the Town of Bedford.\nCampbell was also seeing major growth ahead of the Great Recession but has seen starts and stops throughout the last decade. On the other hand, Amherst and Appomattox have seen little change in their building permit trends over the last two decades.\nRegardless of these changes, there is a severe lack of diverse housing being built in the counties.

Meanwhile, in Appomattox and Campbell, 29 percent of elderly, non-family households (i.e. seniors living alone or with unrelated persons) were cost-burdened in 2019.

    "text": "6.3 Household trends\nLynchburg has steadily lost homeowners, while gaining renters. By 2021, the city had gained a total of 2,563 renters since 2010, while subsequently losing 1,499 homeowners. These changes have left the balance of renter and homeowner households in slight favor of renters, as renter households make up 51 percent of households in the city.This is shift from 2010 when renter households made up 44 percent of all households in the city.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Change in households by tenure in Lynchburg\n\n\n\nBreaking down the changes in tenure by age shows that more and more households of all ages are now renting in the city. The largest increases were among renter households under 45 years old, an obvious result of the many higher education institutions in the city.\nLosses were mainly among 25 to 64 year old homeowners. By 2021, the city had lost 603 25 to 44 year old homeowner households and 909 45 to 64 year old homeowner households.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Cumulative change in households by tenure and age in Lynchburg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong those growing number of renters, most of those households have been two-person households, an addition of 2,011 from 2010 to 2021. Households of three people or less have been declining among homeowners, but four or more person homeowner households surprisingly grew by 409 during this time.\n\n\n\n\nChange in households by size and tenure in Lynchburg\n\n\nThe city has experienced a decreasing number of seniors living alone or with nonrelatives in recent years (-575). This is another contrast to the surrounding counties, where more and more seniors are living alone. Whether this is the result of Lynchburg seniors moving to the counties is not easily discerned, but regardless seniors in the city may find it more difficult to find housing that meets their needs for aging-in-place. Seniors in the city are rather increasingly the head of household (+604) or living with a spouse (+473).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: Change in senior population in Lynchburg\n\n\n\nThe number of single parents living with other families is increasing in the city. From 2010 to 2021, there has been an increase of 330 single parents having to live with others.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: Cumulative change in families living with others in Lynchburg\n\n\n\nAlthough the city was seeing a significant increase in adult (18 to 34 years old) children living with parents between 2016 and 2020, the overall increase was only 558 by 2021, when there were 4,730. These living arrangements, as well as families living with others, are often an indicator of affordability challenges in communities. The increase in 2020 may have likely been a result of pandemic impacts, and the subsequent decrease by 2021 could have been the result of loosening pandemic restrictions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: Cumulative change in adult children living with parents in Lynchburg"

Lower income homeowner households have decreased over a decade, resulting in fewer homeowners making less than $25,000. And while there has been an increase in lower income renter households, there has also been an increase in renter households making $75,000 or more.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.9: Income distribution by tenure in Lynchburg\n\n\n\nMedian household income emphasizes these shifts. Homeowner median household income has increased by 15 percent from 2010 to 2021, while renter income increased by 25 percent. The growth in the median renter income was the result of higher income renters coming into the city, but still the typical renter in the city only makes about half ($38,229) of what a homeowner makes ($75,093).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.10: Median household income by tenure in Lynchburg\n\n\n\nIn the city, Hispanic households have seen major increases in median household income since 2010. As of 2021, Hispanic households have the highest median income at $72,680. White, non-Hispanic households follow at $62,857, a slight increase of about $9,000 from 2010.\nBlack households in the city, however, had consistently low median household incomes. From 2010 to 2021, the Black median household income had only increased by 14 percent, while their white counterparts saw an 18 percent increase, furthering the Black-white income gap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNote about margins of error.

Most of that contribution is composed of single-family housing that is in the homeownership stock. Despite it’s urban environment, the homeownership stock in the city is not diverse and very few duplexes and other smaller housing types are not utilized for homeownership.\nRather, diverse housing is largely used for rental housing. Most of the rental housing stock in the city is made up of single-family and medium-scale multifamily (5 to 19 units).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.12: Distribution of housing stock in Lynchburg in relation to the region\n\n\n\nManufactured home communities exist within the city limits, mainly on the outskirts along major thoroughfares.

Recovery from the Great Recession has still yet to come to the city, but the construction of five or more unit buildings in the city has continued to surpass all other types in recent years. Although the city saw the construction of duplexes and triplexes early on in the 2000s, there have been little to no construction of this type of housing in the city.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.15: Residential building permits by unit type in Lynchburg"

From 2020 onward, there were bumps in the market asking rent that led to a high of $1,106 in the second quarter of 2022. But average market asking rent has been in decline since then and sat at $1,046 by the end of 2022, the lowest average rent over the course of seven years.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.21: Quarterly average market asking rent in Lynchburg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that CoStar data excludes a significant amount of single-family detached rentals, which has been growing in demand across the nation. In the city, there is an estimated 4,922 single-family homes that are being used as rentals. A majority of the detached SFR is located in Ward II, where the College Hill and Diamond Hill neighborhoods are located.\nRental prices for these are not easily discerned, as this type of housing is sometimes marketed on non-traditional channels, like Facebook groups or simply with a yard sign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.22: Map of single-family detached rentals in Lynchburg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.23: Single-family detached rentals by Lynchburg ward\n\n\n\nAs of early 2023, there were a total of 3,651 assisted rental units in the city. While assisted units can be supported by multiples types of federal subsidy, the bulk of these units (35 percent) are supported by the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program.

    "text": "7.2 Land use and zoning\nThis section focused on the relationship between local land use planning/administration and residential development.\n\n7.2.1 Single-family infill incentives in Lynchburg\nIssue: Demand for new homeownership opportunities in the city continues to increase, especially at more affordable prices. However, land and construction costs have also risen, which makes it difficult to build new single-family homes at relatively affordable prices. There is also less easily-developed land within the city limits compared to surrounding counties.\nStatus: The City of Lynchburg has created infrastructure incentives and revised its zoning code to help promote the development of new infill homes. These efforts include covering most water/sewer extensions and cost-sharing curb, gutter, and sidewalk installations. The city has also revised its subdivision regulations to reduce setbacks, lot sizes, and allow cluster-style development.\nSuccesses:\n\nFrom 2017 to 2022, over 600 new single-family homes and over 200 new townhomes were built in the city.\nAs of October 2022, the city had more than 250 new single-family and townhomes under review.\nDevelopers are finding ways to build small homes (under 1,000 sqft) on infill lots with topography issues that otherwise prevent larger homes.\n\nChallenges:\n\nLimited coverage of water and sewer service continue to add extra costs and delays. Some lots that meet all zoning requirements are still unbuildable due to steep slopes and drainage problems. Transportation and accessibility infrastructure (roads, sidewalks, etc.) remain a limiting factor.\n\nOther factors:\n\nThe city will soon begin its comprehensive plan update. This process is an opportunity to proactively align future infrastructure and residential development.\nThe success of single-family infill development is still dependent on certain exogenous factors, especially material/labor costs and mortgage interest rates.\n\nRating:\nContinue. The city should maintain its current regulatory approach to promote new attainable homeownership opportunities, and use the upcoming comprehensive plan update to leverage infrastructure development opportunities to support its infill goals\n\n\n7.2.2 Residential zoning requirements in counties\nIssue: Every county in the region is experiencing demand for new housing, including denser for-sale options and multifamily apartments. Counties will generally require most larger-scale development proposals to go through an entitlement process, such as a rezoning or subdivision plan, outlined in the zoning ordinance. These regulations influence the type, amount, and costs of new residential developments.\nStatus: Every county in the region has an active zoning ordinance. Overall, each county across the region has seen, or has under review, notable amounts of new homes. These include both single-family, townhome, and multifamily units.\nSuccesses:\n\nDevelopers have been able to build townhomes and other smaller homes to meet buyer demand. All homebuilding activity is not concentrated among high-end homes.\nFor the most part, counties are able to direct denser development to designated growth areas through proactive land use planning and service boundaries.\nLimited requirements for curb, gutter, and other similar development components (compared to the City of Lynchburg) reduce upfront costs.\n\nChallenges:\n\nNew demand continues to outpace added supply. Some areas are concerned about an increase in new manufactured home placements on agricultural lots, which is allowed by-right. Those homes remain an attainable source of affordable homeownership.\nDevelopment that is not by-right will often introduce citizen opposition during required public meetings. This NIMBYism can be successful in minimizing or outright ending some proposals. Other factors: Homebuilders and other practitioners explained how elements outside of local control (interest rates, supply issues, etc.) can be just as burdensome as land use regulations.\n\nRating:\nReevaluate. Counties have the opportunity to reexamine their zoning codes to not just build on current successes, but also consider significant changes to better meet post-COVID housing demand.\n\n\n7.2.3 Accessory dwelling unit (ADU) regulations\nIssue: ADUs are smaller homes found on the same property as a larger, primary dwelling. These units can be fully standalone, above a detached garage, or within a home’s existing envelope (e.g., a basement). ADUs can serve relatives, caregivers, and regular tenants, and can provide a lower maintenance, lower cost housing option.\nStatus: Jurisdictions have the authority to regulate the location, size, type, and other characteristics of ADUs in their zoning ordinance. These policies vary across the region. For example, the towns of Appomattox and Altavista have broad flexibility for property owners to build ADUs, and Lynchburg allows them by-right for all residential zones (with certain requirements).\nOn the other hand, ADUs are a special use in Campbell County, and are required to be attached to the main dwelling (not standalone), and occupied only by persons related to the homeowner.\nSuccesses:\n\nLocalities are generally tolerant of ADUs in their zoning code and do not impose stringent restrictions in most circumstances.\nSuccessful permitting of ADUs of different types and in different communities demonstrates viable development opportunities.\n\nChallenges:\n\nLocalities that do have permissible regulations have still not seen significant amounts of ADU permit applications.\nMany homeowners are likely unaware of their potential to create ADUs, and would not know where to start.\nComplete and updated counts of ADUs by locality are not regularly reported by planning departments.\n\nOther factors:\n\nHB 2100 was introduced in the 2023 General Assembly session and would have required localities to permit ADUs in all single-family zones, with certain requirements. The bill failed in committee but ADUs will likely be addressed by lawmakers in the near future.\n\nRating:\nReevaluate. If localities want to promote additional ADU supply, they can explore aligning ordinances with state and national best practices, and creating resources to proactively help homeowners with ADU development."

    "section": "7.3 Housing and community revitalization",
    "text": "7.3 Housing and community revitalization\nThe following policies and programs are connected through their focus on addressing blight and vacancy in the region. They represent a mixture of inspection and enforcement measures alongside redevelopment initiatives.\n\n7.3.1 Building code enforcement and rental inspection programs\nIssue: Inspections are needed in order to identify homes in need of repair, preserve the existing affordable housing stock, and protect existing occupants. This is particularly true in areas with an aging inventory and naturally occurring affordable housing (NOAH) that is limited and typically of a lower quality.\nStatus: The City of Lynchburg has engaged in a variety of initiatives designed to improve the quality of the housing stock while still ensuring attainability and affordability, notably including the Rental Inspection Program, which includes a process for tenants to report quality complaints landlords are not addressing. This has been in effect since 1993, when the city first adopted minimum building maintenance and residential rental dwelling standards for properties within the city limits.\nThe Town of Bedford uses the Redevelopment and Housing Authority as the resource to abate problems related to code enforcement, blight, or development issues, but other counties in the region either do not have explicit inspection programs or recommend future strategies towards enforcing codes as a part of their comprehensive plans.\nThroughout smaller towns in the region, officials noted long-standing issues with code enforcement on properties owned by absentee or negligent owners. However, modest budgets prevent these jurisdictions from hiring staff to enforce the law.\nSuccesses:\n\nAccording to HOME’s 2020 Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing report, the Lynchburg rental inspection program completed 1,500 rental inspections as of 2018 with hundreds of units brought up to code.\nThe Town of Bedford’s Redevelopment and Housing Authority is working to rebuild and improve properties in disrepair by leveraging CDBG grants.\n\nChallenges: - There remain renters that are falling through the cracks of the Lynchburg program, living in unsafe conditions and unable to find or afford alternatives. - Current needs exceed staff capacity in many of the smaller towns in the counties. - Rural blight is less visible and is especially shaped by circumstances including population scarcity, limited physical and economic access to resources, and local government capacity to track and enforce. Many condemned homes in the area are inhabited, and code enforcement could relocate these residents into homelessness.\nOther factors:\n\nMost of the region’s housing is surpassing 20 years in age. A construction boom in the late 20th century (from 1960 to 1999) contributed to much of the region’s homeownership and rental housing stock.\nComplicated relationships between town and county code administration can add additional challenges for residents and developers interested in rehabilitating properties.\n\nRating:\nReevaluate. While most counties include a recommendation or strategy aimed towards addressing aging inventory through code inspection, very little exists in the way of concrete code enforcement plans beyond the Lynchburg rental program. Furthermore, while the Lynchburg rental inspection program has been largely successful, there are opportunities for improvement and outreach with legal aid or other programs working to support low-income renters in the city. Likewise, smaller jurisdictions can explore creative options for increasing their administrative capacity to address property conditions.\n\n\n7.3.2 Tax foreclosures and blight remediation\nIssue: Local governments can enforce the payment of delinquent taxes or, where the initial enforcement process fails, force the transfer of property ownership through tax foreclosure as a way to deal with persistent blight. The ideal tax foreclosure system efficiently and equitably collects tax revenue needed to pay for government services while promoting community stabilization and property maintenance.\nStatus: Lynchburg and Campbell County both reported that their administrations are actively addressing blighted and delinquent properties. In Lynchburg, staff began a pilot vacant/derelict program to improve or demolish problem properties. Of the more than 400 vacant properties tracked by the city, just over 300 have been designated as blight. In Campbell County, conducting tax foreclosures on delinquent properties was described as one of the primary duties currently undertaken by the county attorney.\nSuccesses:\n\nAs of October 2022, the 17 properties in Lynchburg’s pilot derelict program were already slated to be rehabilitated and resold (10), demolished by the city (4), or demolished by the owner (3).\n\nChallenges:\n\nMany foreclosure proceedings are drawn-out and confusing. Further complications can come from the problem of reaching absentee landowners who sometimes live out of state. Though the law provides mechanisms to hold these owners accountable, the procedures are often tedious and span years.\nCollecting accurate counts and relevant data about delinquent and blighted properties can be difficult and time-consuming. As a result, the full scale and scope of these problems is not always easy to ascertain.\n\nOther factors:\n\nVirginia state code is very prescriptive on local governments’ abilities to foreclose on privately-owned properties, even when they are significantly tax delinquent or in very poor condition.\n\nRating:\nContinue. Lynchburg and Campbell County are proactively tackling their housing quality and vacancy problems, although the challenge is much larger than what current efforts are able to address. If these—and other—localities want to expand their capacity to reclaim properties, possible places to begin include better data collection schemes and collaborations with nonprofit and private developers.\n\n\n7.3.3 Main street redevelopment programs\nIssue: Main street redevelopment of small historic towns has been identified as an important investment to stimulate economic growth, promote cultural preservation, improve quality of life and attract new residents, and promote sustainable development practices to preserve the predominantly rural nature of the region. These efforts can help create and retain more diverse housing opportunities in the heart of small towns.\nStatus: Lynchburg and Altavista have successfully utilized funding through the Virginia Main Street Program (VMS) to bring new energy and development into historic downtown areas. The Towns of Bedford and Brookneal are exploring the main street approach for downtown commercial or neighborhood revitalization.\nSuccesses:\n\nThe Town of Altavista received a 2023 Financial Feasibility Grant (FFG) award to determine the highest and best use of the community’s historic Vista Theatre.\nBedford and Brookneal are able to access organizational development services and grant opportunities through the VMS program to prepare them for future grant investments. Bedford is now zoned for upper-level living thanks to help from this program.\n\nChallenges:\n\nSome main street programs, including VMS, are more focused on economic development and do not specifically address housing.\nThe amount of housing specifically generated through main street development can be limited by few actual development opportunities and low developer capacity.\n\nOther factors:\n\nThe Virginia Main Street Program is a preservation-based economic and community development program. The program is administered through DHCD and offers a range of services and assistance to communities interested in revitalizing their historic commercial districts; it was specifically designed to address the need for revitalization and on-going management of smaller to mid-sized downtowns\n\nRating:\nContinue. The Virginia Main Street Program has been a successful resource for towns across the state and within the region to build capacity. New policies and programs connected to these initiatives should consider how to incorporate housing into historic structures or nearby these centers to maximize the benefits of cluster-style developments.\n\n\n7.3.4 Acquire, Renovate, Sell (ARS) program\nIssue: The Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) administers the “Acquire, Renovate and Sell” program to eligible providers including local governments, nonprofits, housing authorities, and planning district commissions. This program aims to create affordable homeownership opportunities for low-to moderate income, first-time homebuyers while allowing providers discretion over acquisition type, region and resale. Providers acquire existing undervalued homes using their own lines of credit, renovate using ARS funding and other leveraged sources if necessary, and resell the property at fair market value to a first-time homebuyer.\nStatus: Currently, only the town of Altavista has utilized ARS funding in the region. In 2021, Altavista was awarded grant funding through DHCD with the goal of acquiring properties in need of repair or build homes on vacant lots and turn them into habitable, affordable homes.\nSuccesses:\n\nAltavista has used the ARS program to develop homes themselves, leveraging philanthropic funds to buy, renovate, and sell homes. Net proceeds from the sales have remained in the town as program income to reinvest in local, affordable housing efforts, like main street revitalization efforts, or to be used to build greater staffing capacity.\n\nChallenges:\n\nThe program is designed for the resale of homes and does not contain a rental component.\nThe program is designed to specifically target homes assessed below market value and cannot be used on other types of homes. This may include but is not limited to homes that are foreclosed, abandoned, vacant, distressed, investor-owned and economically-challenged, estate/divorce/tax sales, or have suffered years of deferred maintenance.\n\nOther factors:\n\nARS is a partnership between the provider, DHCD, and the Virginia Housing Development Authority (VHDA) as financial backer. VHDA provides down payment assistance should the homebuyer obtain their first mortgage through VHDA (FHA, FNMA, USDA, VA).\n\nRating:\nContinue. This has been a successful program in Altavista for recapturing old and vacant properties while generating modest proceeds to pay for local staff and other housing initiatives. This program could be an ideal fit in other parts of the region struggling to address blight and vacancies of single-family homes."

HCVs are federally funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. In Virginia, HCVs are locally administered by a combination of public housing authorities and other government agencies.\nStatus: Housing Choice Vouchers are currently utilized by residents of Lynchburg, the Town of Altavista, Amherst County and Appomattox County. The Nelson County Community Development Foundation in Lovingston administers HCVs for Amherst County and Appomattox County.\nSuccesses:\n\nHCVs have been successful and essential tools in providing suitable housing for low-income residents.\nWhile most of Lynchburg’s assisted housing is located in lower opportunity areas, these areas have better access to public transit that serve important roles for assisted housing tenants.\nLRHA is starting their first phase of a redevelopment project where they hope to increase the total number of HCV units at the Dearington Apartment Complex from 100 to over 242.\n\nChallenges:\n\nIn Lynchburg, landlord resistance to HCVs and transportation are continuing barriers for residents looking for affordable housing options in higher opportunity areas across the city.\nResidents of Appomattox and Amherst counties are in the same voucher pool as residents from Buckingham County, Cumberland County, Nelson County, and Prince Edward County, likely resulting in longer waiting times. Transportation also poses accessibility challenges in the counties, especially for those who live more than thirty minutes away from the voucher office.\n\nOther factors:\n\nNot all families who receive vouchers are able to find a house or apartment where they can use them. Shortages of moderately priced rental housing, tight market conditions, racial and ethnic discrimination, landlords who are unwilling to accept voucher payments, and ineffective local administration all contribute to this problem across the country.\n\nRating:\nReevaluate. LRHA could expand Section 8 HCV Program to higher opportunity areas and continue ongoing landlord recruitment and education programs. Regionally, new collaborations around voucher administration could be explored to address challenges in the counties."

    "section": "7.5 Public housing redevelopment",
    "text": "7.5 Public housing redevelopment\nIssue: Decades-long shifts in federal policy and funding priorities have led to the deterioration of many older public housing communities across the nation. Virginia and the Lynchburg region are no exception. Housing authorities must now look to other programs and resources to transform aging units and continue offering them as a much-needed source of deeply affordable rental housing. These options include Project-based Vouchers, and LIHTC, among others.\nStatus: Most public housing in the region is located in Lynchburg (LRHA) and the Town of Bedford, administered by their respective housing authorities. LRHA owns and operates four public housing locations with a total of 328 units, and currently in Bedford there are seven different housing projects containing 424 individual housing units.\nSuccesses:\n\nIn 2016, $662,772 (63%) of CDBG funds were allocated to Lynchburg’s downtown infrastructure project and rehabilitation of a public housing complex.\nLRHA operates the Affordable Housing Resource Center (AHRC) to serve people with a one stop shop for resources, housing navigation, education, and training opportunities as well as work in City selected neighborhoods on improving housing stock for rental or home-ownership.\n\nChallenges:\n\nThe elderly and persons with disabilities show relatively high representation in voucher-based housing but an underrepresentation in public housing.\nDue to limited resources and hilly topography throughout Lynchburg, handicapped accessible units are limited within LRHA’s public housing inventory, although some progress is being made to address this.\nLengthy wait lists and geographic concentration of public housing are persistent challenges facing public housing.\n\nRating:\nContinue / Reevaluate. Public housing authorities should continue to review and assess the public housing units to meet the Section 504 requirements. PHAs can also continue to monitor and explore HUD programs that can be used to reposition public housing communities for revitalization/redevelopment.\n\n7.5.1 Homebuyer readiness programs\nIssue: Homebuyer readiness programs can help participants lower their housing costs, save more income, improve their credit, avoid delinquency, address defaults, and avoid foreclosure. Increased funding for homeowner education programs has a direct, positive impact on the number of people able to become successful long-term owners.\nStatus: The Lynchburg Community Action Group (Lyn-CAG) is currently the region’s only certified HUD center offering classes to first time homeowners. Both Lyn-CAG and the Greater Lynchburg Habitat for Humanity (GLHFH) offer down payment assistance to first-time homebuyers through HOME funds.\nSuccesses:\nSince 2019, GLFHF and Lyn-CAG have assisted at least four income eligible homebuyers a year to receive down payment assistance towards a home purchase.\nChallenges:\n\nWhile some non profit developers like Habitat for Humanity also offer home buying counseling and down payment assistance, in general there is a lack of this type of program in the region outside of Lynchburg.\nThe shortage of affordable homes available to purchase leaves many homebuyers ready with little to no options.\n\nOther factors:\n\nIn addition to serving first time homebuyers, Lyn-CAG has also received and allocated HOME funds towards substantial rehabilitations for existing homeowners.\nResidents in the region are also able take advantage of DHCD’s statewide financial assistance programs, including the Virginia Individual Development Accounts (VIDA) program, which helps qualified individuals save for a down payment on a home, and the Down Payment Assistance (DPA) program, although it’s unclear how many use this in practice.\n\nRating:\nContinue. As new homes are built in the region, homebuyer readiness programs and financial assistance are vital tools that help first time homebuyers and low-income buyers compete in a crowded market. Assistance should continue and further funding considered to make a larger impact in the region.\n\n\n7.5.2 Low-cost transportation services\nIssue: Affordable housing can become unaffordable if transportation costs are not taken into account. Low-cost transportation is essential for residents to access essential services, stimulate economic development, facilitate social connections, and access education and training opportunities, especially in more geographically dispersed areas.\nStatus: Lynchburg is working to place housing near mobility hubs, park and ride, and other transit stops, and the GLTC operates 14 bus routes within the City of Lynchburg and a portion of Madison Heights every day of the week. The Central Virginia Alliance for Community Living offers the Dial-A-Ride service to provide individuals aged 60 and over with transportation across the counties.\nSuccesses:\n\nThe Bedford County Otter Bus service provides free handicap accessible transportation for residents living in the Town of Bedford. Buses run from apartment complexes directly to grocery stores, government offices, and health resources. Bedford County also provides the Bedford Ride service, which operates similarly to Dial-A-Ride.\n\nChallenges:\n\nDial-A-Ride is not free, has limited hours, and is first-come-first served, making it difficult for regular transportation needs.\nTransportation access will continue to be a challenge if new housing remains spread out across the counties.\n\nOther factors:\nTransportation accessibility and flexibility directly impact the costs and options of childcare for low-income families.\nRating:\nContinue / Reevaluate. The region should continue to explore low-cost or subsidized transportation options where feasible and consider how new housing and services can be clustered in the region."

    "section": "7.6 Homelessness prevention",
    "text": "7.6 Homelessness prevention\nHousing policies are incomplete without a connection to the problem of homelessness. The following programs address efforts to prevent homelessness as well as respond to the emergency needs of unhoused people in the region.\n\n7.6.1 Eviction diversion\nIssue: Eviction diversion programs are an effective tool in preventing homelessness by providing a safety net for tenants who may otherwise fall through the cracks of the housing system. By keeping people in their homes, these programs not only prevent homelessness but also promote housing stability, financial security, and overall well-being.\nStatus: A number of nonprofit organizations and congregations in the region offer rental assistance and legal aid to assist in eviction diversion efforts. The Central Virginia Continuum of Care (CVCoC) has Coordinated Homeless Intake and Access (CHIA) counselors that assist at-risk families across the region with landlord mediation and referrals to the CoC diversion program.\nSuccesses:\n\nIn 2019, 94% of the 103 people that passed through the CVCoC’s eviction diversion program remained housed and avoided the trauma of homelessness.\nLynchburg Community Action Group (Lyn-CAG) also administered an emergency rental assistance program from July 1, 2020, through June 30, 2022, assisting 231 households comprised of 286 persons.\n\nChallenges:\n\nEvictions have continued to rise across the state while funding and resources have failed to keep pace.\nRural regions with more dispersed populations often struggle to account for the often significant number of information evictions in their data.\n\nOther factors:\n\nDHCD’s Virginia Eviction Reduction Pilot is continuing its third year of funding to nonprofits across the state engaged in the work of eviction diversion.\n\nRating:\nContinue. Coordinated care and funding to prevent eviction in the region should continue to be prioritized as a way to avoid long-lasting impacts on families and to prevent the public costs of eviction (including emergency healthcare, shelter, etc.). Efforts to improve tracking of informal evictions is recommended.\n\n\n7.6.2 Coordinated services\nIssue: Coordinated entry processes help communities prioritize assistance based on the type, vulnerability, and severity of service needs to ensure that people who need assistance the most can receive it in a timely manner. Having multiple organizations and contact points in this process ensures that people can reach assistance in a variety of ways.\nStatus: The CVCoC has four major access points for those seeking assistance in the region. LRHA and Lyn-CAG are responsible for the Coordinated Homeless Intake and Access (CHIA) services while the YMCA of Central Virginia offers a 24/7 domestic violence hotline and Miriam’s House is responsible for Homeless Outreach & Mobile Engagement (HOME) services.\nSuccesses:\n\nIn 2022 alone, 462 persons, including 140 homeless children, were reconnected with the safety and security of a home through the work of Miriam’s House, which has continued to increase capacity since 2012.\nIn 2019, the CoC reported 97% of the 300 people who passed through rapid rehousing found permanent supportive housing. CVCoC providers follow a “Housing First” approach to minimize the time households experience homelessness by lowering barriers to project entry, decreasing involuntary discharge and not predicating services on housing readiness.\n\nChallenges:\n\nEmergency shelter capacity is under 200 beds for the entire region, with only 20 located outside of Lynchburg. Getting referred to and finding transportation to these beds can be a challenge for vulnerable populations living outside of the city and little to no options exist through the CoC elsewhere.\n\nRating:\nContinue Low recidivism rates are evidence of the success of the housing-first model. The CVCoC should continue to tackle the issue of homelessness, potentially adding new shelters or transit opportunities in areas of the region that are farther away from existing resources."

    "text": "7.7 Infrastructure investments and planning\nInfrastructure investments are related to the livability and accessibility of housing, making them crucial aspects of current and future planning. The following policies address critical utilities necessary to sustainable development in the region.\n\n7.7.1 Water and sewer expansion\nIssue: Water and sewer infrastructure play a critical role in determining the amount and location of new housing development in a community. Without adequate infrastructure, housing development can be limited, and delays and disruptions accessing these services can make it difficult to secure financing for new construction.\nStatus: The Lynchburg City Council is considering increasing water, storm water and sewer rates in the newest proposed budget to pay for infrastructure investment, increasing regulatory requirements, and rising costs. The Bedford Water Regional Authority is looking to expand a number of its current services, including a rapidly growing area near Smith Mountain Lake.\nSuccesses:\n\nIn 2021, the Bedford Water Regional Authority added 241 new water connections and 134 new sewer connections for residents in the county .\nThe Town of Amherst is working to upgrade their water treatment plant at no cost to the taxpayer through a combination of grants, loans, and city reserves, and should be complete in 2023.\n\nChallenges:\n\nInitial fees for water, wastewater, and other basic infrastructure can be a significant hard cost for affordable housing developers. These expenses are rolled into the project’s financing, increasing the level of debt service needed, and adding to the eventual rent or sales price amounts.\nDistance and logistics, costs, and regulatory requirements are some of the primary barriers to water and sewer expansion in the rural areas of Appomattox, Amherst, and Bedford counties.\nHaving residents share the cost of new infrastructure can add to the overall housing cost burden of the lowest-income populations.\n\nOther factors:\n\nIn 2020, the typical customer in Virginia paid more than $80 for both water and sewer, or roughly $25 more than the average for 2010.\n\nRating:\nReevaluate. The region should explore mechanisms to reduce up-front utility costs to pave the way for the creation and preservation of new dedicated affordable housing.\n\n\n7.7.2 Broadband coverage\nIssue: The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that high-speed internet is a vital tool in everyday life. Disparities in broadband access exacerbate existing inequity throughout Virginia, and access to broadband is a major component of where people wish to live.\nStatus: Coverage is increasing in the region, and efforts are underway to expand access through the numerous statewide broadband funding resources that have become available since 2017, including DHCD’s Virginia Telecommunication Initiative (VATI).\nSuccesses:\n\nIn 2022, Bedford County received $8,523,908.00 and Campbell County received $6,442,563.00 from VATI to expand service.\nAccording to the Commonwealth Connection, half the counties and Lynchburg now serve broadband to the majority of their addresses: Amherst (78%), Appomattox (74%), Lynchburg (99%)\n\nChallenges:\n\nAccording to Commonwealth Connection, Bedford and Campbell continue to have low access rates, with a little over half of all addresses served.\nThere is more money than service providers available to implement expansion plans in parts of the region.\n\nOther factors:\n\nAcross the Commonwealth, more than one-in-three households earning less than $20,000 do not have internet access, compared to fewer than one-in-twenty households earning $75,000 or more.\n\nRating:\nContinue Localities should continue to leverage current state broadband initiatives to expand access and affordability of high-speed internet for residents."

    "text": "7.8 Miscellaneous\nSome programs and policies do not neatly fit into previous categories, but are worth mentioning as issues that could uniquely impact the region.\n\n7.8.1 Short-term rental regulations (STRs)\nIssue: Property owners are listing their homes on AirBnB, VRBO, and other sites as short-term rentals. Stakeholders shared concerns about these STRs limiting housing supply in certain areas of the region, particularly around Smith Mountain Lake.\nStatus: Localities have the authority to regulate STRs through the zoning codes. Across the CVPDC region, however, these restrictions are not consistent. For example, Bedford County saw more than 200 new STRs during the pandemic as the result of looser restrictions; however, Campbell County has many more requirements and approves only 10 per year on average.\nSuccesses:\n\nSome local governments have proactively addressed STRs for several years and are actively monitoring their status.\nLocalities with STR regulations have a better sense of the total number, types, and locations of STRs in their community.\n\nChallenges:\n\nRegulatory inconsistencies across the region may create negative incentives for STR operators to concentrate properties in communities with fewer restrictions.\nThe region-wide impact of STRs is difficult to assess due to lack of registration and tracking in some areas. (AirBnB and other listing services do not make their data publicly accessible.)\n\nOther factors:\nSeveral STR-related bills have been introduced in recent General Assembly sessions that may affect the enabling authorities localities have to regulate these properties.\nRating:\nReevaluate. There are opportunities to make STR regulations across the region more uniform and more responsive to increasing concerns about the potential negative impacts of STR on housing supply.\n\n\n7.8.2 Housing collaborations\nIssue: There is a wide range of different practitioners and providers responsible for housing efforts in the region. These include local governments, housing agencies, nonprofits, and other community groups. Regular coordination between these entities can be a challenge, but promotes collaborative problem-solving and prioritization of challenges.\nStatus: Two cross-sector coalitions are active in the region. The Lynchburg Housing Collaborative was created by council in 2012 and is supported by city and LRHA staff. The Bedford Housing Coalition is managed by the Bedford Area Resource Council.\nSuccesses:\n\nBoth existing groups are active and have regular meetings.\nWhile existing groups are focused primarily on a single locality, representatives from regional organizations and providers participate in both.\nThe Lynchburg Housing Collaborative has produced several studies and reports to help inform policymakers about housing needs. It also developed a housing vision and a series of specific recommendations to improve housing outcomes in the city.\n\nChallenges:\n\nOther localities in the region do not have comparable groups collaborating on housing issues.\nLimited staff/volunteer capacity for these coalitions limits their ability to thoroughly research challenges and develop solutions.\n\nRating:\nContinue New collaborations can be pursued in other localities, as well as at the regional level."

## The importance of a regional housing study
*Housing challenges span local boundaries*

Communities throughout the Central Virginia region face different housing challenges, but the need for more affordable housing is a common thread in rural, suburban, and urban areas. A diverse and accessible housing supply is critical for promoting equitable and sustainable communities, and housing affordability is a basic need for individuals and families at all income levels. A regional housing study acknowledges that housing markets extend beyond individual communities and that decisions made in one area can have far-reaching consequences in neighboring communities.

The Central Virginia Planning District is composed of four primarily rural counties and the city of Lynchburg and its growing suburbs as the central urban core. The region has seen moderate population growth in recent years primarily as a result of domestic migration due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of remote work options. This has led to increases in home prices and rental vacancy declines as higher income workers relocated out of D.C. and larger east coast metros to benefit from the relative affordability of the region. More and more, smaller and older households are being seen in the region, and affordability challenges are continuing to hit people of color, renters, and those living alone the most.

With a wide range of housing for people of all incomes, the region can continue to be a place to call home for both new and existing residents. By adopting a regional perspective, local policymakers can develop more holistic and effective strategies to address housing affordability, equity, transportation, and sustainability, resulting in a more resilient and inclusive regional housing market that aligns with the vision of a thriving region.

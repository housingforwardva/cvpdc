# Background Research

## Executive Summary

A review of past studies and plans was conducted as part of HousingForward Virginia's housing study process for the Central Virginia Planning District Commission. The review includes comprehensive plans, strategic plans, and other housing analysis documents created by the counties and towns within the CVPDC, listed below. The two major goals of this review are:

1.  To understand historic strategies addressing housing needs in the region, including relevant programs and policies identified by regional leadership, and

2.  To identify and organize existing and future housing trends across the region.

Content analysis was performed to determine the presence of repeated words, themes, or concepts across documents.

## Major takeaways from this analysis

1.  Every community in the region has a desire to sustainably guide and shape new development in ways that prevent strains on resources and preserve the character of existing communities, particularly in rural areas.

2.  All localities recognize the need to proactively address their land use regulations and infrastructure investments to promote new development in the places they want to see.

3.  A greater diversity of housing types and improved social/medical infrastructure will be necessary to meet the needs of changing demographics in the region, especially aging seniors.

4.  The need for small-scale mixed use and infill developments in towns, and a growing prevalence of short-term rentals, are examples of specific challenges faced in certain parts of the region.

5.  The uneven distribution of new growth across the region will further stress the housing market without proactive efforts to manage and capitalize on these trends.

These findings contribute to early analysis of existing conditions and compliment local listening sessions held with regional leadership in December 2022.
